# flatforth
### A subroutine-threaded Forth focused on staying brutally simple and facilitating binary generation

All documentation and design notes are inside the assembly file as inline comments.

## State of the Project (6/6/2021)

This repo was created today to reflect my confidence that this project is viable.

Currently, there is a simple Forth prompt which supports very few words, but serves as a proof of concept.
There are no printing words, but the top stack item is returned in the form of the process' exit status.

Hopefully soon there will be compiling words and a more complete vocabulary.
For now, though, it really is just a proof of concept.
